lomont-williams
===============

Quick and dirty Unity3D implementation of the Williams soundsynth (by Lomont).

Inspired by fellow C coder Madgarden, George Broussard and ofc C. Lomont.
Big thanks to @TonyAlbrecht for adding the Editor + wav export + ideas.

---
Known issues:

1 - Lomont's algorithm may lead to infinite loops/weird behaviour depending on the parameters.

---
Ideas:

[Editor]
1 - Add waveform graph view
2 - Add live editing (easy preview)
3 - Add hex display for params
